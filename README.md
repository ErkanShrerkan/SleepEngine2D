# Work In Progress

This is a personal project where I develop features and systems that I didn't get the chance to explore during my time at TGA.

If you want to run it you have to build the third party projects first.

Current controls:
 - Switch between Editor and Game (f4)
 - Toggle movement in Game (F)
 - Move in Game (WASD)
 - Move around the scene in Editor (WASD)
 - Zoom in Editor (Scroll Wheel)
